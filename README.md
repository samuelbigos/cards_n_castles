# Cards'n'Castles

Cards'n'Castles will be a deckbuilding, autobattling, medieval strategy game that's being developed for My First Game Jam: Summer 2020.

In the game you will build a deck of medieval units which you'll strategically position in a series of battles to become the King of England! As you progress, you'll get new cards and new options to deploy on the battlefield. After deployment, the battle is fully automated so you, as the commander, can see your strengths and weaknesses and prepare for the next battle.

# Current progress

* Deployment and battle game phases.
* 8 different units with different abilities and stats, including Man-At-Arms, Archer, Cavalry, Skirmisher, and Mangonel (not all available in the demo battle).
* Grid based attack/move system with basic AI behaviours.
* 16x16 unit sprites, animated sprites for attacks.
* Background grass and rubble distributed by 2D noise, and wind effects from animated grass.

# Roadmap

* Tutorial battle.
* Tooltips to describe unit stats, strengths, and weaknesses.
* Improve AI (move around other units, priority targets).
* Metagame loop, including card rewards for victorious battles.
* Level design.
* Particles and sprite improvements/animations (idle, attack animations).

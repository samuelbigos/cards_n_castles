- Added save game system so progress is saved over multiple sessions.
- Added music that can be turned off in the main menu.
- Fixed cases where units can be deployed on top of each other, which can cause units to not act in battle.
- Changed card deploy behaviour for usability, card will now transform into unit when it's dragged over the deploy zone, and vice-versa, and be 'dropped' when mouse is released.
- Fixed blurred spearman and ram card textures.
- Added retry button during battle.
- Disabled the ability to play cards during a battle, since it was never truly intended and has issues. It is not required to complete the game and does not provide a significant strategical advantage.
- Removed option to pick Militia after first battle since it sets up for much harder following battles.
- Hopefully no new bugs introduced!
